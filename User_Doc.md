## 0. Linux in 5 minutes
ï¼ˆIf you have previous experience, just go to login part and jump to the section 1)

Linux is a kind of operation system (i.e. MacOS, Windows). Unlike other systems you may used now, Linux do not hava a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The may interaction method for you and Linux system is by command. 

Linux tends to be a highly reliable and secure system than any other operating systems, so it is commonly used by scientific computing. 

### 0.1. Login 

As stated, you need use command to access the server. So, command line tools is needed. This is the software **on your own computer** that help us to linke to the server. 

*  Windows user: search a software called `Powerline` in your PC

*  Mac/Linux user: search a software called `Terminal` in your PC

The appearance of this kind of software will look exactly like that in movies: a blue(win) or (black) box that allow you to type commands. Then, to access server, type (note to change things in <> into your own):
```shell
ssh <YOUR UST USERNAME(i.e. wgouaa) >@ee4e147.ece.ust.hk
```
Press `Enter` , then enter your password same as accessing the school email system, you will then be logged into the system.

A quick note on the above command is as follow: in Linux, all command will start with the **software** to be used, and then with **arguments** for that software. Here, `ssh` is the software used and following is the arguments. For each software, always try:

```shell
<SOFTWARE> -h
<SOFTWARE> --help
```

To see the brief introduction of that software and get an insight on how to use it. 

### 0.2 What after?

Here, you have entered the Linux system. The location you logged in is your `HOME` directory. It is just like an folder in your onw PC. All of your personal things can be stored into here. Also, others, except users with access (called `root` user), do not have the access to enter this folder.

A main thing you need to learn is how to move from here to there. In linux, we do not have GUI, so to know where you are and where to go is done by command. To begin with, type
```shell
pwd
```

It will tell you your current directory. You are expected to see something like `/home/<YOU UST USERNAME>`, indicate that you are in here. Also, it tells you that you have 2 level of parent directory to reach the very top of the system. Then, type

```shell
cd ..
ls
```
Here, the first command `cd` is to open a certain directory, and `..` indicate the parent directory. The second command `ls` will list things under where you are (after `cd`, you are in `/home`). It will give you lots of UST usernames (and other things), which is all of your labmates' personal folders. To go back your own folder, just type
```shell
cd <YOUR FOLDER NAME>
```
And will leads you back to where we start (use `pwd` to confirm it). The above procedure is similar as clicking here and there in GUI. Then, other essitial things you may want to know include:
* Common commands: A nice tutorial can be found [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
* Document manipulation: `vim` or other text editors
* Some basic of shell script `example.sh`
* ... 


#### 0.3 Softwares for better server access:
Except for command line tools, there are bunch of softwares that can help you to interact with server:

* `VScode`: will be introduced later
* `MobaXterm`: A windows tool for better server access, also can link GUI between server and you PC (i.e. open matlab in your PC but run code on server)
* `FileZilla`: Specialized in file transfer between server and pc

## 1. Initial setups

### 1.1 Shell configuration

We use `oh-my-zsh` under `zsh` shell for a better experience of command line. Functions like auto suggestion, command auto completion are installed. For your first login, copy following command and run:

```shell
cp /home/Data/.zsh_config/.zshrc $HOME
source $HOME/.zshrc
```
Then you will see the related change. If you do not like the theme preset, you can edit `.zshrc` file under your home directory by changing the `ZSH_THEME` variable. List of avaiable themes are listed [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes). After change that file, please run 
``` shell
source $HOME/.zshrc
```
Again to allow change.

### 1.2 Login without password

Allow logging in without entering password is a very neat solution for every morning. 


### 2.3 (Recommend) VScode integration:

`VScode` have a very nice plugin that can help you interact with server and directly set (nearly) everything in one software. After 

## 2. Modules

In this server, we use `environment-modules` to manage all pacakages/environments installed. It can be viewed as a centrialized software managment system for all things you may need. Main reason for using this tools is to resolve the confict between different version of softwares. 

To load/unload a module that you need, say `matlab`, simply type in command line:

```shell
module load matlab
module unload matlab
```

Then related modules, combined with its environment, will be setup properly. For a complete list of modules and tools in a specific module, please use:

```shell
# Get all module
module avai
# Get details of a module:
module whatis <MODULE NAME>
```
